## Data Analyst - Convexity Sensitivity AI Agent

A bond portfolio risk analytics and AI-assisted sensitivity platform built with Python, PCA, Monte Carlo simulation, machine learning, key-rate duration, convexity analysis, and an interactive Streamlit Bond Risk Lab dashboard.

## Project Objective

Analyze how a fixed-income portfolio responds to changing interest-rate environments and identify the major sources of duration, convexity, yield-curve, and key-rate risk.

The project combines:

- Bond portfolio analytics
- Yield-curve history
- PCA-based yield-curve factor modeling
- Monte Carlo scenario generation
- Duration and convexity P&L estimation
- Key-rate risk attribution
- Random Forest classification
- Neural Network classification
- XGBoost classification
- VaR and Expected Shortfall
- AI-style risk assessment and recommendations
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard
- Automated regression tests
